## Converting Your Certificate

> Credit note: Taken from [APN on Rails](https://github.com/PRX/apn_on_rails)

Once you have the certificate from Apple for your application, export your key
and the apple certificate as p12 files. Here is a quick walkthrough on how to do this:

1. Click the disclosure arrow next to your certificate in Keychain Access and select the certificate and the key.
2. Right click and choose `Export 2 itemsâ€¦`.
3. Choose the p12 format from the drop down and name it `cert.p12`.

Now covert the p12 file to a pem file:

    $ openssl pkcs12 -in cert.p12 -out apple_push_notification.pem -nodes -clcerts
